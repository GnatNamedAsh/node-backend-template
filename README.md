# node-backend-templates
A repo to host a lot of my backend templates for quick start time on node express projects.

## Language choice

I'm pretty chill with Typescript, so that'll be my choice for this. Love it or hate it, it provides a lot more clarity in code.
We all know how ugly JS can get if one doesn't pay attention.

## Design approach

I won't strictly be following OOP/OOD guidelines. I currently don't write personal projects that, and there's something liberating about it.

All that being said, there's no guarantee that you won't see a `class` keyword here or there. This is mostly a template of items to make starting up personal projects that much easier. Express endpoint controllers/middleware tend to be "here's a function that handles these endpoints" versus "here's an object that handles these endpoints" from my own experience dealing with it, so this being my collection of templates, I guess that means it's also opinionated. Oh well. ðŸ¤·

## What templates are here?

It says templates, but I guess it should be template (I'll fix that at some point).

Right now, the template has:

- http responses (cached and uncached)
